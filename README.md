# blender-extra-keyframe-controls
A temporary script to implement Blender 2.7x's keyframing tools in the Blender 2.8 Timeline toolbar for my fellow lazy mammals who dislike learning new things.

## Usage

* Download the .py file
* Start Blender 2.8
* Change one of your windows to the User Preferences editor
* Click Install Add-On From File
* Browse to where you downloaded the .py file
* Select it
* Ensure the add-on is showing and tick its little box
* Click Save User Settings

If you already have a Timeline window open, the next time you mouse over that window the controls should magically reappear. Yay!

## Limitations

Blender 2.8 is in the middle of heavy development at the moment. There is no telling if the bits of Blender's code used by this script are going to be changed. If such a change happens, this script will stop working. Sorry.
